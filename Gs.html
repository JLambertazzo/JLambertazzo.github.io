<p>Welcome! This page is all about the hopes and goals of the 2016, 15 year old Julien.<br> On this page you will find many different things that I hope will happen in the future and things that I hope to do in the future. Whether it is hopes surrounding politics, games, or any kind of entertainment you will find it here, and hopefully you will know me better by the time you reach the bottom of this page.<br><br> If you haven't already I suggest you read through the Likes/Dislikes page first (link at the top of the page) to get to know a bit more basic information on who I am. Once you are done with this page the questions for my future self page will be the next place to go.<br><br><br><br><br><br>To begin the section on my hopes and goals, I'd like to talk about where I want to be in the future. Right now I am in grade 10 and I am about to finish my first semester and I should be starting to study for exams. I am most likely going to go into many science classes in high school and I hope to pursue a career in science in university. I like all of the sciences and what they discover, however, at this time, a path towards a career in physics is what I would like. This might change as I have not yet had an actual physics class yet, but the things that are learned through that field are fascinating. In the future I hope to be able to thrive without my parents as this will allow me to truly live my own life instead of staying curled up in my parent's basement playing video games. I don't really care or have a burning desire to be rich, but I would like a job that provides me with a good living. I also hope that I graduate high school with the high marks I currently have, and keep a similar average throughout my post-secondary education. I don't have a specific area in which I would like to live in the future, but I would like to live somewhere in Canada, preferably outside of Manitoba. I hope to keep in touch with my current friends and make new ones as I live my life. I would also very much like to travel around the world. As all of the people of the world are coming closer and closer together through developing technologies surrounding communication, it will become easier and easier to move around the planet as the years go by and I would like to visit a wide variety of places on the planet I live on. Finally, my greatest hope is just to be happy. By the end of my life I want to be able to look back and be happy with what I did and how I did it. I want to know that I made a difference in people's lives, and I want to know that the people who are and will be the most important to me will continue to be happy when I am no longer around.</p>
