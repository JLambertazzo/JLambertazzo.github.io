    so you can improvise" -Uncle Drew</p>
  <p class="desc" id="fundDesc">In order to perform at a high level in any kind of activity it is
  <strong>necessary</strong> that you master the fundamentals. Basketball is the same way. If you want
  to be able to hit tough shots that wow the crowd, you'll have to know how to sink a
  jumper from the elbow. This website was made to teach you the fundamentals of basketball.
  <br><br><br>Hopefully, you will learn something new here and be able to apply it to your game!</p>
