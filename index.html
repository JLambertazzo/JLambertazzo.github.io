    so you can improvise"<br>-Uncle Drew</p>

  <strong>necessary</strong> that you master the fundamentals. Basketball is the same way. If you want
  to be able to hit tough shots that wow the crowd, you'll have to know how to sink a
  jumper from the elbow. This website was made to teach you the fundamentals of basketball.
  <br><br><br>Hopefully, you will learn something new here and be able to apply it to your game!</p>

  <p class="quote" id="shootQuote">"The third thing is trying to shoot the same way every single shot,
     every single time"<br>-Steph Curry</p>
  <p class="desc" id="shootDesc">Shooting is one of the most important skills in basketball, because of
  the extra space it creates. If a defender has to guard you all the way out to the 3-point line, it leaves
  much more space for the rest of your team to operate in.<br><br><br>Take a look at this page on shooting
  to brush up on your technique, and see some drills you can use to improve your shot.</p>
