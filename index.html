<p>Welcome! If you're on this page you're probably here to mark it or to<br>review in after many years have gone by, either way, hello! This page is<br>all about the FUTURE. On this page I will write to my future self about<br>what I was like and what I want to know. I hope you enjoy this site and I<br>hope that when I read this in the future I will have accomplished my goals.<br>On this site you will find a page on my current likes and dislikes and another<br>page about my hopes and goals so that my future self can look at them and<br>see what he used to be like. Another page on this site will pose questions<br>(some important and some not so important) for my future self to answer,<br>not really benefiting anyone but just for fun.
